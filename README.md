This repository documents my Python learning journey, featuring projects on algorithms, automation, web development, and data analysis, all built with Python 3.12.6. Itâ€™s a work-in-progress as I improve my skills, and I welcome contributions, feedback, and suggestions to grow together in this coding adventure!
